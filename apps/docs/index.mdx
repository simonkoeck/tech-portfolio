Welcome to my **developer docs** — also known as my portfolio.  
Instead of a flashy landing page, I decided to version myself like software and expose my work as an **API**.  
Because honestly, what’s more _developer-friendly_ than `curl`?

---

## What you’ll find here

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="API (coming  soon)" icon="code" href="/api">
    Endpoints where you can fetch my projects.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Changelog" icon="pen-fancy" href="/changelog">
    Release notes of my life - versioned.
  </Card>
</Columns>

---

## Why Docs?

- Because **real devs read docs**.
- Because it’s funnier than yet another “Hi, I’m a full-stack developer” landing page.
- Because if you can handle reading JSON, you can handle working with me.

## Quickstart (coming soon)

```bash
# List all projects
curl https://api.simonkoeck.com/v1/projects

# List a project by id
curl https://api.simonkoeck.com/v1/projects/:id
